# Trained Models

**Info:** This file provides a link to the trained models and their weights.

**Models:** All the trained models and their results can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xrU92HZb4FoEOAKZw2ILF2h9hZiaqxma?usp=sharing).
The models trained on the augmented dataset have been left out in the main folder, the others have been moved to a subfolder.

**Dataset**: a full dataset used in the experiments can be found in the zip file *full_datasets.zip* inside the drive folder.

**Training:**
All models were trained using the following set up:
- Train set size: 5100 
- Test set size: 299
- Adam optimizer with a learning rate 1e-3
- Epochs: 40
- Batch size: 16

Models trained on the baseline dataset had the following set up:
- Train set size: 897 
- Test set size: 299
- Adam optimizer with a learning rate 1e-3
